            <h2>Name and Overview</h2>
            <p>Lango Acholi Anglican Youth Missioners (LAAYM) is a mission group under St. Francis
                Chapel-Makerere University. LAAYM was introduced on the 13th Day of November 2019
                upholding its main purpose as in the book of Mark 16:15 (Go into all the world and preach the
                good news to all the creation) based on the focus of the Chapel in the book of John 12:32</p>

            <div id="more-content" style="display: none;">
                <p>LAAYM, just like any other mission group under the above Chapel. It is a composition of students
                    hailing majorly from Acholi and Lango sub regions who are into a union with full passion to carry
                    out the mantle of success witnessing in line with the values, norms and morals of the Church of
                    Uganda. Every semester breaks. LAAYM purposes to give back to one of the communities in the
                    four Dioceses of Lango, Kitgum, West Lango, the Diocese of Northern Uganda and also other
                    areas occupied by the two ethnicities (like part of Bunyoro and areas of Kampala) or where there
                    is a call for mission.</p>
